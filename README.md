# Loan-Approval-Prediction
The project is a Loan Approval Prediction that illustrates models that predicts whether or not an individual should be given loan
# Project Title

Among all industries, the insurance domain has one of the largest uses of analytics & data science methods.
For instance, this project is an automation loan approval prediction that uses machine learning techniques.
A Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form

# Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to provide an automation of loan approval status that predicts whether we should give someone a loan or not 
depending on his information.
This project provides you a taste of working on datasets from insurance companies that defines
 what challenges are faced there, what strategies are used, which variables influence the outcome of loan status.
 The goal is to provide a real time automation loan approval status through use of machine learning algorithms to reduce risks.

# Problem Description
 Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customer first apply for home loan after that company validates the customer eligibility for loan.

The company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form.
These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process,
they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers.
Here they have provided a partial data set.

# Project Description

This project covers the whole process from problem statement to model development and evaluation:

- Problem Statement
- Hypothesis Generation
- Data Collection
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Pre-processing
- Model Building and Evaluation
- Model Saving
- Conclusion

The projects consists of statistical analysis, data visualizations and a machine
learning predictive modeling.
We have implemented three machine learning techniques which are;
- Logistic Regression
- Gaussian
- Random Forest Classifier

## Machine Learning Model Predictions

Logistic Regression has proven to be the best machine learning
technique in this project. The accuracy score is about 78% and on both Logistic and the RandomForest Classifier. 
Lastly the Gausssian model with 76% accuracy.

So in conclusion we used the Logistic Regression Model to to build an automated
Loan Approval Prediction System.
